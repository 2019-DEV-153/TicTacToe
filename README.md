# TIC TAC TOE

Tic Tac Toe is a 2-player game. Each player takes turn to mark a segment with X or O depending on their turn.

## Rules

* X always goes first.

* Players cannot play on a played position.

* Players alternate placing X’s and O’s on the board until either:

*-One player has three in a row either by horizontal, vertical or diagonal*

*-All nine squares are filled.*

* If a player is able to draw three X’s or three O’s in a row, that player wins.

* If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
